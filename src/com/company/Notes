Algorithm = Instructions
Implementation = coding the instructions

Arrays
    - Every element occupies the same amount of space.
    - String arrays or other array objects only store the objects reference. This means they still only occupy the same amount of space.
    - Arrays start at zero because of the equations to find the elements.

Sorting
    - Unstable array = Has duplicates yet the duplications can swap ahead of places in the array.
    - Stable array = Duplicates stay in order relative to there position.

Recursion
    - algorithms that call itself
    - Recursion doesn't return until it is done executing the recursion. Make sure to have a return method that doesn't call
    the recursion when the base case is met.
    - Java doesn't use tail recursion
